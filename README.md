# Project Title:

## üé• filmTO üéûÔ∏è

## Overview

What is your app? Brief description in a couple of sentences.

filmTO is an interactive online guide for film enthusiasts. This app highlights Toronto's historic independent art cinemas, recommends multicultural film festivals, and suggests popular movies and related YouTube channels based on users' viewing habits.

### Problem

Why is your app needed? Background information around any pain points or other reasons.

Toronto welcomes many newcomers, including students and immigrants, each year. As one of them, I understand how eager these individuals are to participate in local activities, explore different cultures, and make new friends.

As a film enthusiast, I noticed Toronto has many film-related events, but they are often hard to find. People miss out on free summer park movie festivals, TIFF under 25 free memberships, and other events because information is poorly presented online. Google searches for film festivals or art cinemas in Toronto often yield disappointing results.

The pandemic has further impacted independent cinemas, with many struggling to stay open. For example, Revue Cinema nearly closed last month.

filmTO aims to bridge this gap by connecting film enthusiasts with exciting events. It will aggregate information about film-related activities and venues, helping film festivals find their audiences and ensuring viewers never miss events they're interested in.

### User Profile

Who will use your app? How will they use it? Any special considerations that your app must take into account.

- Film Enthusiasts in Toronto:
  - Individuals who seek more than just commercial films at Cineplex.
  - Passionate about attending multicultural film festivals.
  - Actively support art and independent cinemas.
  - Eager to connect with fellow film lovers and share their viewing experiences.

### Features

### Auth

Does your project include any login or user profile functionality? If so, describe how authentication/authorization will be implemented.

- JWT auth
  - Before adding auth, all API requests will be using a fake user with id 1
  - Added after core features have first been implemented
  - Store JWT in localStorage, remove when a user logs out
  - Add states for logged in showing different UI in places listed in mockups
