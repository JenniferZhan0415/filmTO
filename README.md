## Overview

> Q: What is your app? Brief description in a couple of sentences.

`filmTO` is an _interactive_ online guide for film enthusiasts üé¶. This app _highlights_ Toronto's independent art cinemas with rich history, _recommends_ multicultural film festivals, and _suggests_ popular movies based on users' viewing habits.

### Problem

> Q: Why is your app needed? Background information around any pain points or other reasons.

Toronto welcomes many newcomers, including students and immigrants, each year. As one of them, I understand how eager these individuals are to participate in local activities, explore different cultures, and make new friends.

As a film enthusiast, I noticed Toronto has many film-related events, but they are often hard to find. People miss out on free summer park movie festivals, TIFF under 25 free memberships, and other events because information is poorly presented online. Google searches for film festivals or art cinemas in Toronto often yield disappointing results.

The pandemic has further impacted independent cinemas, with many struggling to stay open. For example, Revue Cinema nearly closed last month.

`filmTO` aims to bridge this gap by connecting film enthusiasts with exciting events. It will aggregate information about film-related activities and venues, helping art house cinemas and film festivals find their audiences, also ensuring viewers never miss events they're interested in.

### User Profile

> Q: Who will use your app? How will they use it? Any special considerations that your app must take into account.

- Film Enthusiasts in Toronto:
  - Individuals who seek more than just commercial films at Cineplex.
