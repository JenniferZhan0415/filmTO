## Overview

`filmTO` is an _interactive_ online guide for film enthusiasts üé¶. This app _highlights_ Toronto's independent art cinemas with rich history, _recommends_ multicultural film festivals, and _suggests_ popular movies based on users' interests.

## How to start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

2. Populate env variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local

# update .env.local accordingly
```

3. Initialize database

Run PostgreSQL server locally:

```bash
docker compose up -d

# to stop the database and clean volumes
docker compose down -v
```

Run database migrations and seedings:

```bash
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate

## Proposal

### Problem

Toronto welcomes many newcomers, including students and immigrants, each year. As one of them, I understand how eager these individuals are to participate in local activities, explore different cultures, and make new friends.

As a film enthusiast, I noticed Toronto has many film-related events, but they are often hard to find. People miss out on free summer park movie festivals, TIFF under 25 free memberships, and other events because information is poorly presented online. Google searches for film festivals or art cinemas in Toronto often yield disappointing results.

The pandemic has further impacted independent cinemas, with many struggling to stay open. For example, Revue Cinema nearly closed last month.

`filmTO` aims to bridge this gap by connecting film enthusiasts with exciting events. It will aggregate information about film-related activities and venues, helping art house cinemas and film festivals find their audiences, also ensuring viewers never miss events they're interested in.

### User Profile

- Film Enthusiasts in Toronto:
  - Individuals who seek more than just commercial films at Cineplex.
  - Passionate about attending multicultural film festivals.
  - Actively support art and independent cinemas.
  - Eager to connect with fellow film lovers and share their viewing experiences.

### Features

- As a user, I want to be able to **find the closest art house cinema** near my current or any given location.

- As a user, I want to know which **film festivals** are currently happening.
